# SI7021-MicroPython-RPi-Pico
Si7021 Temperature and Relative Humidity Sensor

I had ordered a Si7021 from Adafruit, looking for another Temp sensor for my arsonal of goodies to hone my coding skills on the RPi Pico.

While I was waiting on it to arrive, I started looking on the web for a library that would support it and I found one that looked like it would fill the bill at https://github.com/robert-hh/SI7021.  I downloaded the repository and eagerly awaited delivery.

As soon as it arrived, I unpacked it and plugged it in, only to have my "worst" fears justified.  It threw an error...
